# 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days

[題目敘述](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within days days.

The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i]. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within days days.

 

### Example 1:

> **Input:** weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
> **Output:** 15
> **Explanation:** A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum > to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
> - 1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
> - 2nd day: 6, 7
> - 3rd day: 8
> - 4th day: 9
> - 5th day: 10
> 
> Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.


### Example 2:

> **Input:** weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
> **Output:** 6
> **Explanation:** A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
> - 1st day: 3, 2
> - 2nd day: 2, 4
> - 3rd day: 1, 4


### Example 3:
> **Input:** weights = [1,2,3,1,1], days = 4
> **Output:** 3
> **Explanation:**
> - 1st day: 1
> - 2nd day: 2
> - 3rd day: 3
> - 4th day: 1, 1

### 解題思路
船可以載的最輕重量為`weights`的最大值，我們用`maxLoad`來存它;而船最多能載的重量為所有貨物的總和，用`totalLoad`變數來儲存。

所以我們的範圍為`l = maxLoad ~ r = totalLoad`，接著我們用***binary search***的方式去找出`mid = (l + r) / 2`能否在指定的天數內載完全部貨物

- 如果可以，我們知道答案最多可能是`mid`，所以我們設定`r = mid`來繼續搜尋最佳的答案。
- 反之，小於等於`mid`的值都不可能是答案，所依我們設定`l = mid + 1`來繼續搜尋答案。

### Algorithm
1. Initialize two integer variables, `totalLoad` and `maxLoad`. `totalLoad` stores the sum of all the elements of `weights` and `maxLoad` stores the largest element of `weights`.
2. Create a method feasible which takes `weights`, `c`, `days` as the parameters and returns true if we can ship all the packages with `c` capacity.
3. Perform binary search over the range `maxLoad` to `totalLoad`.
4. Create two variables, `l` and `r`, to represent the beginning and end of the range. Set `l = maxLoad` and `r = totalLoad`. We can always ship all the `weights` within `days` days with `r` capacity.
    - Then, while `l < r`:
    - Find the midpoint of the range `(l, r)` in the variable `mid = (l + r) / 2`.
    - Call `feasible(weights, mid, days)` to see if we can ship all the weights in `days` days while using `mid` as the ship's capacity.
    - If we can ship the packages with `mid` as ship's capacity in less than or equal to `days` days, we move to lower half of the range by setting `r = mid`.
    - Otherwise, if we cannot ship the packages with `m` capacity in required days, we move to upper half of the range by setting `l = mid + 1`.
5. Return `l` (or `r`) when `l = r`.


### C++
```cpp=
class Solution {
public:
    bool feasible(vector<int>& weights, int c, int days) {
        int daysNeeded = 1, currLoad = 0;
        for (int weight: weights) {
            currLoad += weight;
            if (currLoad > c) {
                daysNeeded ++;
                currLoad = weight;
            }
        }
        return daysNeeded <= days;
    }

    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int days) {
        int totalLoad = 0, maxLoad = 0;
        for (int weight: weights) {
            totalLoad += weight;
            maxLoad = max(maxLoad, weight);
        }

        int l = maxLoad, r = totalLoad;
        while (l < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) /2;
            if (feasible(weights, mid, days)) {
                r = mid;
            } else {
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python=
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        maxLoad, totalLoad = 0, 0
        for w in weights: 
            totalLoad += w
            maxLoad = max(maxLoad, w)

        l, r = maxLoad, totalLoad
        while l < r :
            mid = l + (r-l)//2
            if self.feasible(weights, mid, days):
                r = mid
            else :
                l = mid + 1
        return l

    def feasible(self, weights: List[int], c: int, days: int) -> bool:
        daysNeeded, currLoad = 1, 0
        for w in weights:
            currLoad += w
            if currLoad > c:
                daysNeeded += 1
                currLoad = w
        return daysNeeded <= days
