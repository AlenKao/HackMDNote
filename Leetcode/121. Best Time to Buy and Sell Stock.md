# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

[題目連結](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

### Example 1:

> **Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
> **Output:** 5
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

### Example 2:

> **Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
> **Output:** 0
> **Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

### C++
```cpp=
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
        int n = prices.size();
        if (n<=1) return 0;
        
        int sum = 0 , maxPro = 0;
        
        for (int i=1; i<n; i++) {
            int change = prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            sum = max(sum+change, change);
            maxPro = max(sum, maxPro);
        }
        return maxPro;        
    }
};
```

### Python
```python=
class Solution:
    # dynamic programming & greedy
    # two pointer
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, 1 # 買賣的位置
        ans = 0
        while right < len(prices):
            ans = max(ans, prices[right] - prices[left])
            # 後面日期的價格小於目前買進的價格
            if prices[left] > prices[right]:
                left = right # 把買進的日期改為此天
            right += 1
        return ans
```
