# 1675. Minimize Deviation in Array

[題目連結](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-deviation-in-array/)

You are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers.  

You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:
- If the element is **even, divide** it by `2`.
    - For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the last element, and the array will be `[1,2,3,2]`.
- If the element is odd, multiply it by `2`.
    - For example, if the array is `[1,2,3,4]`, then you can do this operation on the first element, and the array will be `[2,2,3,4]`.

The **deviation** of the array is the **maximum difference** between any two elements in the array.  

Return the **minimum deviation** the array can have after performing some number of operations.  

### Example 1:
> **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]  
> **Output:** 1  
> **Explanation:** You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2], then to [2,2,3,2], then the deviation will be 3 - 2 = 1.  

### Example 2:
> **Input:** nums = [4,1,5,20,3]  
> **Output:** 3  
> **Explanation:** You can transform the array after two operations to [4,2,5,5,3], then the deviation will be 5 - 2 = 3.  

### Example 3:
> **Input:** nums = [2,10,8]  
> **Output:** 3

### 解題思路
The intuition behind this logic is to reduce the maximum difference between any two elements in the array by either decreasing the maximum value or increasing the minimum value.

By transforming all odd numbers to even numbers, we can always divide even numbers by 2, so the maximum value in the array can be reduced to its minimum possible value. We also keep track of the minimum value in the array, since we can only increase it by multiplying it by 2.

We then repeatedly pop the maximum value from the priority queue, which guarantees that we are always reducing the maximum value in the array. If the maximum value is odd, we can no longer divide it by 2, so we break out of the loop. Otherwise, we divide the maximum value by 2, which reduces the maximum value, and update the minimum value accordingly.

By doing this repeatedly, we can always reduce the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, and we keep track of the minimum deviation that we can achieve.

### Algorithm
1. Create a max heap and a variable to keep track of the minimum value in the array.
2. For each number in the input array, if it is odd, multiply it by 2 and push it onto the heap. Otherwise, just push it onto the heap.
3. Also, update the minimum value if necessary.
4. Initialize a variable to keep track of the minimum deviation.
5. While the maximum value in the heap is even, pop it off the heap, divide it by 2, and push it back onto the heap. Update the minimum deviation and the minimum value if necessary.
6. If the maximum value in the heap is odd, we cannot reduce it any further by dividing by 2. In this case, break out of the loop.
7. Return the minimum deviation.

### C++
```cpp=
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeviation(vector<int>& nums) {
        priority_queue<int> q;
        for (int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] % 2 == 1) nums[i] *= 2;
            q.push(nums[i]);
        }
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int mn = nums[0];
        int dev = nums[nums.size()-1] - mn;
        while (true) {
            int mx = q.top();
            q.pop();
            int dif = mx - mn;
            dev = min(dev, dif);
            if (mx % 2 == 1) break;
            mx /= 2;
            mn = min(mn, mx);
            q.push(mx);
        }
        return dev;
    }
};
```

### Python
```python=
class Solution:
    def minimumDeviation(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        q = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] % 2 == 1:
                nums[i] *= 2 # to even
            heappush(q, -nums[i])
        nums.sort()
        mn = nums[0]
        dev = nums[len(nums)-1] - nums[0]
        while 1:
            mx = -heappop(q)
            dif = mx - mn
            dev = min(dev, dif)
            if mx % 2 == 1: 
                break
            mx //= 2
            mn = min(mn, mx)
            heapq.heappush(q, -mx)
        return dev
```
