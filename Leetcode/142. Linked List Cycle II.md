# 142. Linked List Cycle II

[題目連結](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)


Given the `head` of a linked list, return *the node where the cycle begins*. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

**Do not modify** the linked list.

### Example 1:

> **Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
> **Output:** tail connects to node index 1
> **Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

### Example 2:
![](https://i.imgur.com/FzeORtC.png)
> **Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0
> **Output:** tail connects to node index 0
> **Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

### Example 3:

> **Input:** head = [1], pos = -1
> **Output:** no cycle
> **Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

## 解題思路
[龜兔賽跑算法](https://hackmd.io/@leetcodeguy/floyd_cycle_detection)

The problem asks to find the node where a cycle begins in a given linked list, or return null if there is no cycle. This can be done using the [Floyd's Cycle Detection algorithm](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/Floyd%E5%88%A4%E5%9C%88%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95), also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm.

## Approach
In this algorithm, we use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. We start both pointers at the `head` of the linked list. Then, we move the `slow` pointer **one step** at a time, and the `fast` pointer **two steps** at a time. **If there is a cycle in the linked list, the two pointers will eventually meet at some point**. Otherwise, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the linked list.

Once the two pointers meet, we reset the `slow` pointer to the `head` of the linked list, and move both pointers **one step** at a time. The point where the two pointers meet again is the node where the cycle begins.

```cpp=
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            if (slow == fast) {
                slow = head;
                while (slow != fast) {
                    slow = slow->next;
                    fast = fast->next;
                }
                return fast;
            }
        }
        return nullptr;
    }
};
```

## Java

public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (slow == fast) {
                slow = head;
                while (slow != fast) {
                    slow = slow.next;
                    fast = fast.next;
                }   
                return fast;
