# 2187. Minimum Time to Complete Trips

[題目連結](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-complete-trips/)

You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the `ith` bus to complete **one trip**.

Each bus can make multiple trips **successively**; that is, the next trip can start **immediately after** completing the current trip. Also, each bus operates **independently**; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.

You are also given an integer `totalTrips`, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make **in total**. Return the **minimum time** required for all buses to complete **at least** `totalTrips` trips.

### Example 1:
> **Input:** time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5
> **Output:** 3
> **Explanation:**
> - At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. 
> The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
> - At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0]. 
> The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.
> - At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1]. 
> The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.
> So the minimum time needed for all buses to complete at least 5 trips is 3.

### Example 2:
> **Input:** time = [2], totalTrips = 1
> **Output:** 2
> **Explanation:**
There is only one bus, and it will complete its first trip at t = 2.
So the minimum time needed to complete 1 trip is 2.

### Example 3:
> **Input:** time = [10000], totalTrips = 10000000
> **Output:** 100000000000

## 解題思路
用 binary search，要注意的地方是 return 型態是 long，以及要如何訂 right 的初始值。


## C++
```cpp=
class Solution {
public:
    long long calTrip(vector<int> time, long long mid) {
        long long sum = 0;
        for (long long i : time) {
            sum += mid / i;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    long long minimumTime(vector<int>& time, int totalTrips) {
        long long l = 1, r;
        int tmp = INT_MAX;
        for (int i: time) tmp = min(tmp, i);
        r = static_cast<long long>(tmp * static_cast<long>(totalTrips));

        while (l < r) {
            long long mid = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (calTrip(time, mid) >= totalTrips) r = mid;
            else l = mid + 1;
        }
        return l;
    }
};
```

## Java
```java=
class Solution {
    public long minimumTime(int[] time, int totalTrips) {
        long left = 0, right = (long)time[time.length - 1] * (long)totalTrips;
        long mid = 0, count = 0;

        while(left < right){
            mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            count = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < time.length; i++){
                count += mid / time[i];
                if(count > totalTrips){
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(count >= totalTrips){
                right = mid;
            }
            else if(count < totalTrips){
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return right;
    }
}
```

## Python
```python=
class Solution:
  def minimumTime(self, time: List[int], totalTrips: int) -> int:
    l = 1
    r = min(time) * totalTrips

    while l < r:
      m = l + (r - l) // 2
      if sum(m // t for t in time) >= totalTrips:
        r = m
      else:
        l = m + 1

    return l
```
