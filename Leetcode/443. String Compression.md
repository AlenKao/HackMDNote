# 443. String Compression

[題目連結](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

- If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
- Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array**, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

### Example 1:
> **Input:** chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
> **Output:** Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
> **Explanation:** The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".

### Example 2:
> **Input:** chars = ["a"]
> **Output:** Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
> **Explanation:** The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

### Example 3:
> **Input:** chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
> **Output:** Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
> **Explanation:** The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".

### Approach:
1. Initialize two pointers, i and j, to 0. Pointer i will be used to traverse the input array, while pointer j will be used to modify the array in place.
2. While i is less than the length of the input array, do the following:
    - a. Initialize a variable count to 1. This variable will keep track of the number of consecutive repeating characters in the input array.
    - b. While i is less than the length of the input array minus 1, and the character at index i is equal to the character at index i+1, increment count and i.
    - c. Write the character at index i to the output array at index j, and increment both i and j.
    - d. If count is greater than 1, convert it to a string and write each character of the string to the output array at index j, incrementing j for each character.
3. Return j, which is the length of the compressed array.

### C++
```cpp=
class Solution {
public:
    int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
        if (chars.size() == 1) return 1;

        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < chars.size()) {
            int cnt = 1;
            while (i < chars.size()-1 && chars[i] == chars[i+1]) {
                cnt ++;
                i ++;
            }
            chars[j++] = chars[i++];
            if (cnt > 1) {
                string s = to_string(cnt);
                for (char c : s) chars[j++] = c;
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
};
```

### Java
```java=
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int count = 1;
        int index = 1;
        char temp = chars[0];
        
        for(int i = 1; i < chars.length; i++){
            if(chars[i] == temp){
                count++;
            }
            else{
                if(count > 1){
                    String word = Integer.toString(count);
                    for(int j = 0; j < word.length(); j++){
                        chars[index++] = word.charAt(j);
                    }
                }
                
                chars[index++] = chars[i];
                temp = chars[i];
                count = 1;
            }
        }

        if(count > 1){
            String word = Integer.toString(count);
            for(int j = 0; j < word.length(); j++){
                chars[index++] = word.charAt(j);
            }
        }

        return index;
    }
}
```

### Python
```python=
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        n = len(chars)
        if n == 1: return 1      
        i = j = 0     
        while i < n:
            cnt = 1
            while i < n - 1 and chars[i] == chars[i+1]:
                cnt += 1
                i += 1         
            chars[j] = chars[i]
            j += 1           
            if cnt > 1:
                for c in str(cnt):
                    chars[j] = c
                    j += 1           
            i += 1       
        return j
```
