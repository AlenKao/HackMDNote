# 72. Edit Distance

[題目連結](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/description/)

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

### Example 1:

> **Input:** word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
> **Output:** 3
> **Explanation:** 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')

### Example 2:

> **Input:** word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
> **Output:** 5
> **Explanation:** 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')

### 解題思路
1. If `word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`. That is, no operation is required because the characters at positions `i-1` and `j-1` are already the same.
2. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the minimum of the following three values:
    - `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`: replace the character at position `i-1` in word1 with the character at position `j-1` in `word2`.
    - `dp[i-1][j] + 1`: delete the character at position `i-1` in `word1`.
    - `dp[i][j-1] + 1`: insert the character at position `j-1` in `word2` into word1 at position `i`.
3. The base cases are:
    - `dp[i][0] = i`: transforming `word1[0...i-1`] into an empty string requires `i` deletions.
    - `dp[0][j] = j`: transforming an empty string into `word2[0...j-1]` requires `j` insertions.
4. Finally, return `dp[m][n]`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to transform `word1` into `word2`, where `n` is the length of `word1` and `m` is the length of `word2`.

### Python
```python=
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        n, m = len(word1), len(word2)
        dp = [[0] * (m+1) for _ in range(n+1)] # dp[n+1][m+1]
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            dp[i][0] = i
        for j in range(1, m+1):
            dp[0][j] = j
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(1, m+1):
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1
        return dp[n][m]
```
