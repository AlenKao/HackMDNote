# 427. Construct Quad Tree

[題目敘述](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-quad-tree/)

Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0's` and `1's` only. We want to represent the `grid` with a Quad-Tree.

Return *the root of the Quad-Tree representing the `grid`*.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to **True** or **False** when `isLeaf` is **False**, and both are **accepted** in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

* `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
* `isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

```java!
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.

If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.

Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

> If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).

**Quad-Tree format:**

The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as 1 in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as 0.

### Example 1:

> **Input:** grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
> **Output:** [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
> **Explanation:** The explanation of this example is shown below:
> Notice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.

### Example 2:

> **Input:** grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
> **Output:** [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
> **Explanation:** All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
> The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
> The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.

### 解題思路
利用 dfs 將 Matrix 分解到最後變成 1 length，在將其回傳會去，形成最終答案。

### Approach:
1. Define a recursive function build that takes in the current grid as well as the indices `row_start`, `row_end`, `col_start`, `col_end`.
2. Check if the current grid is a leaf node. If yes, create a new node and set its `isLeaf` and `val` attributes to `true` or `false` based on the value of the current grid.
3. Otherwise, create a new node and set its `isLeaf` attribute to `false` and `val` attribute to `true` (since it does not matter).
4. Divide the current grid into four sub-grids by calculating the midpoints of the current row and column ranges: `mid_row = (row_start + row_end) / 2` and `mid_col = (col_start + col_end) / 2`.
5. Recursively build each of the four sub-grids and set the corresponding child node of the current node to the result.
6. Return the current node.
7. Call the build function with the entire grid and return the `root` node.

    public Node construct(int[][] grid) {
        Node ans = dfs(grid, grid.length, 0, 0);
        return ans;
    }

    public Node dfs(int[][] grid, int length, int i, int j){
        if(length == 1){
            return new Node(grid[i][j] == 1, true);
        }

        Node root = new Node();
        Node topLeft = dfs(grid, length / 2, i, j);
        Node topRight = dfs(grid, length / 2, i, j + length / 2);
        Node bottomLeft = dfs(grid, length / 2, i + length / 2, j);
        Node bottomRight = dfs(grid, length / 2, i + length / 2, j + length / 2);

        if(topLeft.isLeaf && topRight.isLeaf && bottomLeft.isLeaf && bottomRight.isLeaf && topLeft.val == topRight.val && topLeft.val == bottomLeft.val && topLeft.val == bottomRight.val){
            root.val = topLeft.val;
            root.isLeaf = true;
        }
        else{
            root.topLeft = topLeft;
            root.topRight = topRight;
            root.bottomLeft = bottomLeft;
            root.bottomRight = bottomRight;
